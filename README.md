  <h1> About </h1>
Here you can find out all my activities in Software University. Every code is tested in <a href="https://softuni.bg/certificates/details/182590/579852f2"> SoftUni Judge System</a> and archived in this repository. 
  
  I have created folders just to be more organised. That's how it looks like:
</div>

- 📁**Course name**
  - 📁Labs-And-Homeworks
    - 📁Lecture name
       - 📄 name of the task
  - 📁More-Exercises
       - 📄 name of the task
  - 📁Type of the exam - date /``day-month-year``/
       - 📄 name of the task

<div align='center'>
In 'Certificates' you can find all courses I have finished. As you can see they are sorted as a tables.
